# Introduction
The gender wage gap is a popularly debated topic within the public sphere; however,
what happens when we analyze the pay disparity within a traditionally male-dominated space,
such as basketball? While most gender wage gap statistics present an aggregate of all fields,
we aim to answer questions regarding the pay gap in the NBA and WNBA. In addition, we also
aim to explore what these numbers say about the entertainment industry and the audience it
attracts. Another question we aim to answer is whether the factors that determine salary are
based on skills and performance or something more immutable, like gender. We also aim to
inquire whether there is a pay disparity even between certain NBA and WNBA players; would
this entail the top earners continuing to dominate? Additionally, can we make predictions, taking
in information about a player, and determine how much a player may make? For future NBA or
WNBA stars, this analysis may shed light on the reality of the dream. As regular people in
society, the analysis may reveal certain discriminatory patterns displayed in the entertainment
industry and may further raise additional questions as to what we, as consumers, can do in
order to bridge the potential gender wage disparity. Furthermore, how can major corporations do
better in closing the gender wage gap within the sports industry?
With the data we have found, we are confident that we will not only be able to deeply
dive into the pay gap between women and men professional basketball players, but we will also
be able to answer the questions we presented above. Discovering why there is discrimination
between gender and wage in the NBA is vital to better understanding overall inequalities in all
professional sports alike. By focusing solely on the NBA, we aim to seek answers from
performance, age, and position differences to understand how the large gap came to be. This is
a relevant and important topic to better understand because as the pay gap continues to grow
every year, WNBA and women athletes in different fields are left to seek different career paths
outside of their passion. This is a real-world issue and with the proper information and with
further insight, we aim to be able to answer many big social problems surrounding gender
discrimination in the workplace. Gender discrimination happens in so many areas of our lives
and we hope to achieve some reason as to why this happens on stages as big as professional
sports. Should a male professional basketball player be making almost 150 times what a female
professional player makes? In great effort, we attempt to compare male versus female
professional basketball playersâ€™ wages, position, and statistical comparisons to better
understand what made this giant gap and how it can be lessened in the future. Changing the
way professional sports players are paid is such an important part of what the future of sports
holds, but in order to change, we first need to discover why and how it came to be.


# Conclusion / Summary Takeaways

Based on our three tabs with different information about comparing various aspects of players from both leagues and their salaries, we found that there is gender-based discrimination in the pay gap. The first tab shows the gender wage gap, comparing the pay disparity between the NBA and WNBA. It questions whether top earners continue to dominate and if predictions about player salaries can be made. It also considers how major corporations can help close the gender wage gap within the sports industry. The text emphasizes the importance of addressing gender discrimination in the workplace, highlighting professional sports as a significant arena where such disparities exist. It questions the fairness of male basketball players earning significantly more than their female counterparts. The second tab examines the relationship between the number of games played by NBA and WNBA players and their salaries. It implies that playing statistics could impact player earnings, as more games usually indicate higher performance. However, despite NBA players playing more games than WNBA players, the analysis reveals a substantial pay gap between the two leagues, even when players have similar playing time. This discrepancy highlights the challenges encountered by professional female basketball players, who face fewer playing opportunities and receive considerably lower pay compared to male players. The third tab shows us a bar graph that compares in-game averages from an NBA player and a WNBA player. This tab, in addition to the second tab, allows us to visualize how player stats may compare to their salary. We looked accross the players stats and their athletic ability and even though the NBA players beat out the WNBA players in some aspects, like the number of games played, there is still a large pay gap that is not justified by the small difference in stats. It is important to look at various data based on gender discrimination because on platforms as big as the NBA and WNBA, there is still a great deal of bias and inequality.
